=Dubious for App Engine

==Introducing Dubious
This is s starter project for Duby on App Engine. Dubious provide a way to build apps in Duby, with conventions familiar to Rails and Sinatra developers. Duby has no runtime dependencies, everything is compiled ahead-of-time. Duby apps have none of the initialization costs associated with JRuby. Dubious supports ERb and has a simple datastore adapter that uses a syntax similar to DataMapper, but the form and tag helpers are currently missing.

==Introducing Duby
Duby is a new language with Ruby-inspired syntax that compiles to JVM bytecode. Duby is statically typed, with local type inference, and a simple macro system. The goal is to make Duby as expressive as Ruby without introducing any runtime library and while maintaining Javaâ€™s level of performance. Just write code that looks like Ruby, but reference the Java docs to find out what method calls to make. Duby uses the Java type system.

==Setup the Duby development environment 

Fetch App Engine Java SDK and JRuby, then install them into /usr/local

* http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/appengine-java-sdk-1.3.5.zip
* http://jruby.org.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/1.5.1/jruby-bin-1.5.1.tar.gz

Make sure the appengine tools are executable

   sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/appengine-java-sdk-1.3.5/bin/*.sh

Now git clone bitescript and duby to your drive

   mkdir -p ~/mystuff; cd ~/mystuff
   git clone http://github.com/headius/duby.git
   git clone http://github.com/headius/bitescript.git

Edit .bash_profile to find these tools

   export JRUBY_HOME=/usr/local/jruby-1.5.1
   export DUBY_HOME=~/mystuff/duby
   export APPENGINE_JAVA_SDK=/usr/local/appengine-java-sdk-1.3.5
   export PATH=$PATH:$JRUBY_HOME/bin:$DUBY_HOME/bin:$APPENGINE_JAVA_SDK/bin

Verify tools are configured properly, and check to see
that script/build.sh has the correct path to the SDK.

   which appcfg.sh
   which dev_appserver.sh
   which duby
   which jruby

Now compile the duby files and run the app locally

   ./script/build.sh
   ./script/server.sh

Edit the app-id in app.yaml, then publish to appspot.com

   ./script/publish.sh
